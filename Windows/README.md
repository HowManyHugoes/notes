# Displays the version in a window 
winver

# Displays the version in the terminal
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version"
```

## Know the domain

```powershell
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"Domain"
wmic computersystem get domain

## Know whether a service is running on a port number

Run in PowerShell:
```powershell
netstat -an -b | grep <port_number>
```

## Wipe all the deleted data / free space on a drive

```powershell
# Overwrites the deallocated space on drive C:
cipher /w:C
```

Cipher goes through the following steps:

1. creates the folder `C:\EFSTMPWP`

1. creates a first file in that folder filled with `0`, making it grow until the hard drive fills up

1. deletes that file and creates a second one filled with `255`, making it grow until the hard drive fills up

1. deletes the second file, creates a third file filled with random numbers, making it grow until the hard drive fills up again

1. deletes the third file and returns you to the prompt
