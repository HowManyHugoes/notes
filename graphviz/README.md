# graphviz

[Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) is open source graph visualization software: it takes the description of a graph in a simple text language and generates an image out of it. 

Write your graph nodes and edges in a `diagram.dot` file and then run the following command to generate a PNG image out of it:

```sh
dot -Tpng diagram.dot > diagram.png
```

Use [WebGraphviz](http://www.webgraphviz.com/) to try graphviz in the browser.
